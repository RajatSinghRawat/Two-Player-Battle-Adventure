# Two-Player-Battle-Adventure
Two Player Battle Adventure is text based based in which both the players have two choices in their every turn, whether to attack the other player or heal yourself.
This project is based on C++ programming language. I tried to implement OOPs concept in this project. Thank You !!

Rules For Playing The Game: 
1. Each Player has only one turn at a time.
2. Each Type Of Player has different Health, Damage, Additional Damage and Healing Capacity.
3. Each Player has two options in each turn: Either to do the damage to other Player or Heal yourself
4. When one's health reaches zero, the other player is the winner.
